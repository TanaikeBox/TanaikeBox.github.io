      <description>About Me I&amp;rsquo;m Japanese and scientist with Ph.D. in Physics. My curiosity is to quest, think and create. Especially, I always like to create new things which are not exist in this world yet.
Basically I find such new things during sleep. I had performed most of my large discoveries during sleep. In fact, I had discovered new materials, structures, methods, designs and etc during sleep so far. Although new discovery during sleep depends on my mental and physical states, I had produced various new things for the real world so far.</description>
